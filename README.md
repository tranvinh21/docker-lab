### Refactoring Docker Knowledge

I'm currently refactoring my knowledge about Docker. Although I learned Docker
in the past, my understanding was quite basic. It mainly revolved around:

- What is Docker, image, container, Dockerfile, docker-compose, etc.?
- How to deploy Docker on production?
- How to integrate CI/CD with Docker?

These are the kind of things I learned and applied in my work. However, now I
want to delve deeper into DevOps, specifically exploring technologies like
Kubernetes (k8s), Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (eks), Amazon
Elastic Container Service (ecs), and many other areas I'm not familiar with. For
now, I'm focusing on learning Kubernetes first.

Upon starting this journey, I've realized that my Docker knowledge is
insufficient, and it's causing me a lot of problems. Therefore, today I want to
re-learn Docker in more detail, gaining a deeper understanding of "What is
Docker"?
